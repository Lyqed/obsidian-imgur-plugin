# Development how-to

### Prerequisites

- Get a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Development

- It is recommended to create a new Obsidian vault for development
- `git clone` the repo to any place on your filesystem and enter the directory you cloned
- `npm install` once to resolve project dependencies
- `npm run dev` to mount the plugin to Obsidian vault and have hot-reload
  where you would like to test it and get instant feedback on any change in your code
